    <p>100 prisoners are numbered 1 to 100 and forced to
       enter a room one at a time. They are not allowed to communicate with the
       other prisoners after they go in. The room contains 100 closed
       boxes labeled 1 to 100 on the outside. 100 pieces of paper are 
       labeled 1 to 100 and randomly placed inside each box so that 
       they can't be removed. Therefore, most of the boxes contain 
       numbers which don't coincide with their outside numbers. Each 
       prisoner is allowed to open no more than 50 boxes to find their
       number. If each of the 100 prisoners finds their number, they
       are all spared. If even one prisoner does not find their own
       number, they all will be executed. Assuming the prisoners
       can discuss it beforehand, what strategy can they execute
       to give them a 30% chance of survival?
